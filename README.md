# dijkstra-algorithm
This is a simple Python 3 implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm which returns the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph. It only uses the Python standard library, and should work with any Python 3.x version. I've tested it with Python 3.4 and Python 3.7.

For a walkthrough of how it works, see the blog post [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://www.dougmahugh.com/dijkstra/).
